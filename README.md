STuneLite
=========

A flexible framework for semi-automatically performance tuning software

Many applications have lots of configuration parameters like sizes for
buffers and time/effort limits.  Picking the right values for these
parameters is a pain in the butt, so most of the time they have some
hopefully not too bad default value.  This project is an easy to use
framework for automatically tuning these parameters.  The hope is that
it is flexible enough to be useful for a wide range of applications.

The name of the project is inspired by SQLite, which is a simple
lightweight database library used by a huge range of different
applications.
